= SimpleCi

SimpleCi is a tool to allow you to automatically run a set of command line commands on a project and store the results whenever the project's master branch is commited to.

For example you might have a rails app and when you commit to *master you want to run a set of tests, ie: `bundle exec rake spec` and `bundle exec cucumber -p all`.  SimpleCi allows you to define a project (with path to a git repo) and the commands you want to run.  Now when you commit to master both these will be automatically run and the outcome from them will be displayed on the projects page.
